# **Gun Violence Analysis (2013â€“2018)**  
**A Data-Driven Analysis Using Python, Tableau, and Machine Learning**

---

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores **gun violence incidents in the United States** between **2013 and 2018** using data sourced from the **Gun Violence Archive**. The analysis focuses on uncovering trends, identifying geographic and demographic patterns, understanding incident characteristics, and predicting future gun violence trends through **time series forecasting**.

The results of this project aim to inform **policymakers, law enforcement, and communities** about actionable steps to reduce gun violence.
